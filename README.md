## Developer Dao Minim

TODO 
- add a small explanation below the divider to explain what is it
- write down the process to be done (merge request process to get your name on it)
- if needed there needs to be a small guide on how to :
    - what is git and why is it used
    - install git 
    - create a github account 
    - what are forks , branches , commits

- things need to look a lil bit better visually 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
